# Repository to hold projects as part of the React training

This project contains my code for various assignments set during my React training with CTS.

There are two high level separations: With Hooks and Without Hooks. As the name suggests, with each assignment (from training session 4 onwards - where class components was first used) - I have implemented my code using both the older style class components and separately using Hooks (i.e. only functional components).
